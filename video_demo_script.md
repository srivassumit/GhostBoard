## Part 1: FanPlay — The Universal Translator (0:00 – 1:00)

**⏱️ 0:00–0:10 — Hook (Universal Truth)**
*   **Visual:** Show standard broadcast footage of a complex, fast-paced play.
*   **Audio:** “Sports broadcasts assume you already know the rules — but fans actually exist on a spectrum.” *(Pause for effect)*

**⏱️ 0:10–0:20 — Insight (Differentiation)**
*   **Visual:** Show the **FanPlay** dashboard.
*   **Audio:** “So we built a system that explains the *same* moment differently depending on where you are on your fan journey.”

**⏱️ 0:20–0:40 — The Demo (The Aha)**
*   **Visual:**
    1.  Play a clip briefly (e.g., a tennis rally or soccer goal).
    2.  Click **Beginner** (🐣). Show the simple, analogy-based text appearing.
    3.  *Read aloud:* "It's like playing tag, but the ball is 'it'." (or similar simple analogy).
    4.  Click **Hardcore** (🔥). Show the technical stats and jargon appear instantly.
*   **Audio:** “Nothing about the play changed — *only the explanation did*.”

**⏱️ 0:40–0:55 — Impact**
*   **Visual:** Pan over the interface showing the dynamic sport icons (🎾 to 🏈).
*   **Audio:** “This helps new fans feel welcome, helps casual fans engage, and gives hardcore fans the depth they want — all without fragmenting the experience.”

**⏱️ 0:55–1:00 — The Transition**
*   **Audio:** “We don’t change the game — we change how people understand it.”
*   **Visual:** Mouse moves from the **FANPLAY** tab to the **GHOSTPLAY** tab.

## Part 2: GhostPlay — The Tactical Time Machine (1:00 – 2:00)

**⏱️ 1:00–1:10 — The Coach's Problem**
*   **Visual:** Show a video clip of a team conceding a goal.
*   **Audio:** “But understanding is only half the battle. Coaches *hate* this moment. They can tell a player 'you were out of position,' but they usually can't *show* the alternative.”

**⏱️ 1:10–1:30 — The "GhostBoard" Solution**
*   **Visual:**
    1.  User enters **GhostPlay** mode.
    2.  Click **Analyze**. The video freezes, and the **Tactical Board** overlays perfectly on top.
*   **Audio:** “Enter GhostPlay. We don't just analyze the video; we extract the reality. Watch this.”

**⏱️ 1:30–1:50 — The Counterfactual**
*   **Visual:**
    1.  Mouse grabs the defender (who was out of position).
    2.  User moves the node into the passing lane.
    3.  Click **Run Simulation**.
    4.  Show the animation/replay and the Win Probability Gauge updating.
*   **Audio:** “I can now grab this defender—who was too slow—and move him into the passing lane. I ask Gemini to simulate the counterfactual. Interception probability rises to 85%.”

**⏱️ 1:50–2:00 — Close**
*   **Visual:** Split screen showing both modes (Fan & Ghost) side-by-side, then fade to **PLAYLENS** logo.
*   **Audio:** “GhostPlay turns hindsight into foresight. Open Source. Built from scratch. Thank you.”
